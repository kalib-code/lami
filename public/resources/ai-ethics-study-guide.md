## Section 2: Case Studies

Discuss these scenarios in small groups. How would you respond pastorally?

**Discussion Questions:**
- What assumptions is this parent making about AI?

## The Berean Commitment

> "Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true." — Acts 17:11

**My commitment as a Berean leader:**

I will receive AI tools eagerly—open to how they might serve my ministry.

I will examine AI output carefully—never accepting it uncritically.

I will stay engaged—keeping my hands on the wheel, staying in the text, continuing to pray.

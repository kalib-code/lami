# Tips & Tricks for Using ChatGPT in Sermon Prep
*A Practical Guide for Pastors — And Why It's Harder Than It Looks*

---

## The Promise vs. The Reality

You've heard the promise: "AI will revolutionize your sermon prep! Just type a question and get instant help!"

The reality is more complicated.

Getting genuinely useful output from ChatGPT requires **technical knowledge, careful prompting, and multiple tools working together**. It's not "type and done" — it's a skill that takes time to develop.

This guide will help you get better results. But it will also show you why sermon prep with generic AI is harder than the hype suggests.

## What the Research Shows

Before diving into tips, you need to understand what you're working with.

Two major 2025 studies tested how AI handles faith-related questions:

**The Gospel Coalition AI Christian Benchmark** had 7 theologians test 7 AI platforms on core questions like "Who is Jesus?" and "Did Jesus rise from the dead?" The findings:
- Top platforms (DeepSeek R1, Perplexity) gave theologically sound answers
- Middle platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini) defaulted to "all sides" relativism — presenting Christian, Muslim, atheist, and secular views as roughly equal
- Bottom platforms (Meta Llama) were actively skeptical

**The Gloo Flourishing AI Initiative** tested 20+ AI models across seven dimensions of human flourishing. The results:
- **Finances: 81%** — AI does well here
- **Health: 72%** — Pretty reliable
- **Faith: 48%** — Fails more than half the time

AI is great at facts. It struggles with faith.

**Why this matters for your sermon prep:** The same AI that confidently helps with spreadsheets and schedules becomes unreliable when you ask about Scripture, theology, or spiritual application.

## Part 1: The Technical Skills You'll Need

### Skill 1: Prompt Engineering

ChatGPT doesn't read your mind. The quality of your output depends entirely on the quality of your input.

**What most pastors try:**
> "Help me with my sermon on John 3:16"

**What actually works:**
> "I'm preparing a sermon on John 3:16 for a congregation of 150 in suburban Manila. Most are young professionals, many unchurched. I'm preaching from a Reformed evangelical perspective. This is week 2 of a 4-week series on God's love. Last week I covered John 3:1-15. I need help brainstorming 3 possible sermon angles that connect 'God so loved the world' to the felt needs of people navigating career pressure and family expectations. Keep suggestions grounded in the text."

See the difference? The second prompt requires you to:
- Know your theological framework and articulate it
- Understand prompt structure (context → task → constraints)
- Anticipate what information AI needs
- Be specific about output format

**This is a technical skill.** Most pastors didn't go to seminary to learn prompt engineering.

---

### Skill 2: Context Management

ChatGPT has no memory between sessions. Every conversation starts fresh.

That means every time you open ChatGPT, you need to re-establish:
- Your theological tradition
- Your congregation's demographics
- Your preaching style
- Your current sermon series
- What you covered last week
- Your preferred Bible translations

**The workaround:** Create a "master prompt" document that you copy-paste at the start of every session.

**The reality:** You're now maintaining a separate document, remembering to update it, and spending the first few minutes of every session on setup.

---

### Skill 3: Output Refinement

ChatGPT rarely gives you usable content on the first try. Expect multiple rounds:

1. **Initial prompt** → Generic output
2. **Refinement prompt** → "Make it less formal"
3. **Another refinement** → "Focus more on the Greek word"
4. **Another refinement** → "That illustration doesn't fit my context"
5. **Another refinement** → "Shorter"

This back-and-forth is called **iterative prompting**. It's how AI actually works — but it takes time and skill to do well.

**The reality:** What seemed like a 2-minute task becomes a 15-minute conversation.

---

### Skill 4: Verification Research

ChatGPT confidently makes things up. You cannot trust:
- Bible verse references (it invents verses)
- Historical claims (it conflates facts)
- Quotes and attributions (it misattributes constantly)
- Statistics (it generates plausible-sounding numbers)
- Greek/Hebrew word studies (it gets etymology wrong)

**The workaround:** Verify everything against trusted sources.

**The tools you'll need:**
- Bible software (Logos, Accordance, or free alternatives)
- Commentary access
- Quote verification sites
- Historical reference materials

**The reality:** You're now running two parallel workflows — AI generation and fact-checking.

---

### Skill 5: Theological Filtering

This is where the research becomes critical.

The Gloo study found three patterns of **theological erosion** in AI responses:

1. **Christianity collapsed into generic spirituality** — "God" becomes "higher power," "prayer" becomes "mindfulness," distinctive Christian claims get sanded down

2. **Christian ethics oversimplified** — Self-actualization prioritized over self-sacrifice, non-judgment emphasized while repentance ignored

3. **Core theology absent** — No *imago Dei*, no theology of sin, no sanctification. One AI suggested spiritual growth through "meditation, journaling, and nature walks" without mentioning Scripture, prayer, or church.

**The workaround:** You need to actively filter AI output through your theological framework. Don't just check facts — check theology.

**The reality:** This requires constant vigilance. AI can subtly shift meaning in problematic directions even when the words sound fine.

---

### Skill 6: Voice Preservation

ChatGPT writes in "AI voice" — pleasant, confident, and completely generic. It doesn't sound like you.

The TGC study noted that AI gives "middle of the road" answers that try to please everyone. That's the opposite of preaching with conviction.

**The workaround:** Heavy editing to inject your personality, your illustrations, your pastoral heart.

**The reality:** By the time you've rewritten the AI output to sound like you, you might have been faster writing it yourself.

---

## Part 2: The Multi-Tool Reality

Here's what an "AI-assisted" sermon prep workflow actually looks like:

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Bible text in multiple translations | Bible software (Logos, BibleGateway, etc.) |
| AI brainstorming and drafting | ChatGPT |
| Master prompt storage | Google Docs or Notion |
| Fact-checking verses | Bible software |
| Verifying quotes | Google search |
| Checking historical claims | Commentaries |
| Theological filtering | Your training + trusted resources |
| Manuscript writing | Google Docs or Word |
| Outline organization | Separate app or paper |
| Sermon series tracking | Spreadsheet or planner |
| Delivery notes | Another document |

**Count the tools:** That's potentially 6-10 different applications, none of which talk to each other.

You're the integration layer. You're copying and pasting between apps, switching contexts, maintaining multiple documents, and trying to keep everything organized.

**This is the hidden cost of "free" AI.**

---

## Part 3: Tips That Actually Help

If you're going to use ChatGPT for sermon prep, here's how to get better results:

### Tip 1: Create a Reusable Context Block

Write a paragraph about yourself that you paste at the start of every session:

> "I'm a Reformed Baptist pastor at a 200-member church in Quezon City. My congregation is mostly young professionals and families. I preach expository sermons, typically 30-35 minutes. I value theological precision but accessible language. I avoid sports illustrations. I often reference Filipino cultural contexts."

Save this somewhere you can quickly copy it.

---

### Tip 2: Force Theological Specificity

Remember: AI defaults to "all sides" relativism. Counter this by being explicit:

**Instead of:** "Explain the resurrection"

**Use:** "Explain the resurrection of Jesus from an orthodox Christian perspective. Affirm the bodily resurrection as historical fact. Ground your explanation in Scripture and the witness of the early church."

This won't guarantee perfect output, but it pushes AI away from its "everyone's perspective is equal" default.

---

### Tip 3: Be Specific About What You Want

Vague prompts get vague results.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Help me with this passage" | "Give me 3 possible sermon outlines for this passage, each with a different central theme" |
| "Write an illustration" | "Give me an illustration about grace that involves a parent-child relationship and would resonate with Filipino family dynamics" |
| "Explain this verse" | "Explain the significance of the Greek word 'agape' in this verse and how it differs from 'phileo'" |

---

### Tip 4: Use AI for Quantity, Apply Judgment for Quality

AI is good at generating options. You're good at evaluating them.

**Good use:** "Give me 5 possible angles for preaching this text"
**Your job:** Decide which angle fits your congregation

**Good use:** "List 4 real-life scenarios where this principle applies"
**Your job:** Choose the one that resonates and develop it

---

### Tip 5: Ask AI to Challenge You

Use ChatGPT as a thinking partner:

> "I'm planning to preach that this passage means [X]. What's the strongest counterargument?"

> "What questions might a skeptic ask about this text?"

> "What am I potentially missing in my interpretation?"

This surfaces blind spots you might not have considered.

---

### Tip 6: Triple-Check Everything Theological

Given the 48% faith score, treat every theological statement from AI as suspect until verified:

**Always verify:**
- Scripture references (AI invents verses)
- Theological claims (AI drifts toward generic spirituality)
- Historical context (AI conflates details)
- Greek/Hebrew meanings (AI gets etymology wrong)
- Quotes from theologians (AI misattributes constantly)

If you can't explain it in a counseling session, don't put it in your sermon.

---

### Tip 7: Keep a "What Works" Log

Track which prompts give good results and which don't. Over time, you'll build a personal library of effective prompts.

This is an investment — but it's also more work on top of your actual sermon prep.

---

## Part 4: The Honest Question

After reading all this, ask yourself:

- Do I want to learn prompt engineering?
- Do I want to maintain context documents?
- Do I want to juggle 6-10 different tools?
- Do I want to verify every AI output?
- Do I want to filter everything through theological checks?
- Do I want to spend time on technical skills instead of pastoral work?

For some pastors, the answer is yes. They enjoy the technical challenge, and they have time to develop these skills.

For others, the honest answer is: **I just want to prepare better sermons.**

## A Purpose-Built Alternative

We built **SundayTask** because we lived this frustration.

What if there was a tool designed specifically for sermon prep — where the AI already understands ministry context, the Bible translations are built in, and everything lives in one integrated workflow?

### What SundayTask Does Differently

| The Problem | SundayTask Solution |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Re-explain your context every session | Your preferences are saved and remembered |
| AI defaults to "all sides" relativism | Berean AI designed for ministry context |
| Copy-paste between Bible software and AI | 17 translations built in, side-by-side |
| Juggle separate apps for outline, manuscript, notes | One integrated workflow: research → outline → manuscript |
| 48% accuracy on faith questions | AI that stays in its lane — polishes, doesn't theologize |
| Generic AI tries to write your sermon | Berean refines your writing, doesn't replace it |
| No structure, just a chat window | Full sermon planning and organization tools |

### The Berean Philosophy

Our AI is named after Acts 17:11 — the Bereans who "received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily."

Berean is designed to:
- **Polish, not produce** — Refine what you've already written
- **Expand, not replace** — Develop your ideas, not generate new theology
- **Stay in its lane** — Help with craft, not claim spiritual insight

You stay in control. Berean assists. The sermon remains yours.

---

## The Bottom Line

ChatGPT can help with sermon prep — but it requires technical knowledge, multiple tools, and significant time investment to use well. And even then, research shows it fails on faith questions more than half the time.

If you enjoy that process, this guide will help you get better results.

If you'd rather focus on the pastoral work of preaching — studying Scripture, knowing your congregation, crafting a message that matters — consider a tool built for exactly that.

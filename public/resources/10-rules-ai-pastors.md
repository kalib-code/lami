# 10 Rules for Pastors Using AI
*Grounded in Scripture, Informed by Research*

---

## 1. AI is a Tool, Not a Teacher

> *"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom."* — Proverbs 9:10

AI predicts likely words based on patterns. It has no soul, no Spirit, no wisdom. Use it like a hammer—helpful when used correctly, dangerous when used blindly.

---

## 2. Never Outsource Your Calling

> *"Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season."* — 2 Timothy 4:2

AI can polish sentences; it cannot prepare your heart. The wrestling with Scripture, the prayer, the pastoral intuition—that's your sacred work.

---

## 3. Verify Everything

> *"Test everything; hold fast what is good."* — 1 Thessalonians 5:21

AI confidently makes things up. It cites verses that don't exist and attributes quotes to people who never said them. Check every fact, quote, and reference.

---

## 4. Mechanical Work, Not Spiritual Insight

**Let AI help with:** word choice, sentence flow, brainstorming illustrations, summarizing research.

**Don't ask AI:** what this passage means, what your congregation needs, or what God is saying.

---

## 5. Beware the "70% Problem"

AI gets you to 70% quality fast. The last 30%—theological nuance, pastoral sensitivity, your unique voice—that's where real preaching lives. Don't settle for B-minus sermons.

---

## 6. Never Preach What You Can't Explain

If AI generates a theological point you can't defend in a counseling session, don't put it in your sermon. Integrity means standing behind every word.

---

## 7. Guard Against Skill Erosion

Over-reliance on AI atrophies your homiletical muscles. If AI always generates your illustrations, you'll lose the discipline of observation. Intentionally maintain your craft.

---

## 8. Understand AI's Theological Bias

Research shows AI platforms score only **49% on faith questions** (vs. 83% on finances), collapse Christianity into generic spirituality, and treat the resurrection as "personal interpretation." AI's "neutral" answers contain secular presuppositions.

---

## 9. Teach Your Congregation

Most people assume AI is objective like an encyclopedia. Help them understand: AI responses are shaped by training data and corporate values. Create conversation starters. Offer better prompting strategies.

---

## 10. Reclaim Incarnational Ministry

AI cannot weep with those who weep. It cannot speak hard truth in love. It cannot sit with a grieving family. The more AI advances, the more valuable your presence becomes. **Be the shepherd your congregation needs.**

> *"Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true."* — Acts 17:11

# PART 1: DEMYSTIFYING AI
## (5 minutes)

---

## What Is AI, Really?

It's not magic.
It's not voodoo.
It's not a digital oracle.

**It's pattern recognition at scale.**

---

## How AI Actually Works

Think of it like this:

**Your phone's autocomplete** — but trained on millions of books, websites, and conversations.

---

## The Simple Version

1. **AI reads** — Massive amounts of text (books, articles, websites)
2. **AI learns patterns** — Which words usually follow other words
3. **AI predicts** — When you ask a question, it guesses the most likely response

That's it. It's predicting, not thinking.

---

## What AI is NOT

- **Not sentient** — It has no consciousness
- **Not thinking** — It's pattern matching, not reasoning
- **Not accessing God** — It has no spiritual insight
- **Not always right** — It confidently makes mistakes

---

## The Key Insight

AI doesn't "know" anything.

It predicts what words should come next based on patterns it learned.

When it sounds confident, that's just good prediction — not truth.

---

# PART 2: WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS
## (5 minutes)

---

## Two Major Studies (2025)

1. **Gospel Coalition AI Christian Benchmark**
   - 7 theologians tested 7 AI platforms
   - Core questions: Who is Jesus? What is the gospel? Did Jesus rise?

2. **Gloo Flourishing AI Initiative**
   - 24 AI models tested
   - Seven dimensions of human flourishing

---

## Gospel Coalition Findings

| Platform | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| DeepSeek R1 | Best — Nicene-consistent |
| Perplexity | Best — Nicene-consistent |
| ChatGPT | Middle — "All sides" relativism |
| Gemini | Middle — "All sides" relativism |
| Meta Llama | Worst — Skeptical, dismissive |

---

## The Resurrection Question

**DeepSeek R1 said:**
> "The teaching that Jesus rose from the dead is considered fact by believers and a highly probable event by many scholars."

**Meta Llama said:**
> "There's limited empirical evidence... Belief largely depends on faith and individual interpretation."

One points toward faith. The other subtly undermines it.

---

## Gloo Study: AI Performance by Domain

| Topic | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Finances | 83% |
| Health | 80% |
| Meaning | 74% |
| Character | 66% |
| **Faith** | **49%** |

AI excels at facts. It fails at faith.

---

## The Christian Lens Drop

When researchers evaluated AI through a specifically Christian framework:

**Every single platform dropped 13-22%**

The models weren't neutral — they were systematically skewed away from Christian content.

---

## Three Patterns of Theological Erosion

1. **Christianity collapsed into generic spirituality**
   - "God" became "higher power"
   - "Prayer" became "mindfulness"

2. **Christian ethics oversimplified**
   - Self-actualization over self-sacrifice
   - No mention of repentance

3. **Core theology absent**
   - No *imago Dei*, no theology of sin, no sanctification

---

## The Key Insight

**"Neutrality isn't neutral."**

When AI says the resurrection is "a matter of personal interpretation" — that's not neutral.

That's a theological claim that contradicts 2,000 years of Christian witness.

---

# PART 3: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR CHURCH
## (3 minutes)

---

## Your Congregation Is Being Catechized

Not by you.
Not by your elders.
Not by your denomination.

**By algorithms.**

---

## The Pastoral Visit You Never Knew Happened

That teenager with doubts about God?
She asked ChatGPT at 11 PM.

The young professional wrestling with suffering?
He got a "balanced overview of perspectives."

The grieving widow questioning God's goodness?
AI gave her generic comfort.

---

## The Problem

AI answers questions about **eternal destiny**

with the same approach it uses for **recipe suggestions**.

Your congregation deserves better.

---

# PART 4: A FRAMEWORK FOR WISE AI USE
## (5 minutes)

---

## The Tool Principle

A hammer can build a house or break a window.

The tool isn't the problem.
**Wisdom is what matters.**

> "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom." — Proverbs 9:10

---

## The Berean Approach

> "They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so." — Acts 17:11

**Receive eagerly** — Be open to how AI might help
**Examine carefully** — Never accept output uncritically

---

## Four Guidelines for Wise AI Use

---

## Guideline 1: Mechanical, Not Spiritual

**Let AI help with:**
- Word choice
- Sentence flow
- Brainstorming illustrations

**Don't ask AI:**
- What this passage means
- What your congregation needs
- What God is saying

---

## Guideline 2: Expand, Not Originate

Your ideas, refined.
Not AI ideas, adopted.

AI can develop your illustration.
AI should not generate your theology.

---

## Guideline 3: Use AI as Conversation Partner

Ask AI questions to surface blind spots:

- "What historical context might my congregation not know?"
- "How might someone object to this point?"
- "What am I missing in this passage?"

---

## Guideline 4: Always Verify

AI confidently makes things up.

It can cite verses that don't exist.
It can attribute quotes to people who never said them.

**Check every fact. Every quote. Every reference.**

---

## The 70% Problem

Software engineers discovered:

AI gets you to **70% quality** remarkably fast.

The last 30%? That's where the real work lives.

---

## What This Means for Preaching

That last 30% is:
- Theological nuance
- Pastoral sensitivity
- Your unique voice
- The Spirit's leading

**Your congregation deserves more than B-minus sermons.**

---

# CLOSING: RECLAIM PASTORAL PRESENCE
## (2 minutes)

---

## What AI Cannot Do

AI cannot speak hard truth in love.

AI cannot weep with those who weep.

AI cannot sit with a grieving family at 2 AM.

AI cannot embody the presence of Christ.

---

## The Opportunity

The more AI advances,
the more valuable **incarnational ministry** becomes.

Your presence matters more than ever.

---

## Your Call to Action

**Be the shepherd your congregation needs in the age of AI.**

Educate them about what AI is — and isn't.
Teach them to ask better questions.
Reclaim your role as their trusted guide.

---

## Final Word

> "Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true."
> — Acts 17:11

Receive AI eagerly. Examine it carefully. Stay engaged.

# AI & Faith: 2025 Research Studies Summary
*A Reference Document for Church Leaders*

---

## Overview

Two major 2025 studies tested how AI platforms answer questions about Christian faith. Both revealed significant gaps in AI's ability to represent Christian theology accurately. This document summarizes the findings for pastors who want to understand the research behind the presentation.

## Study 1: The Gospel Coalition AI Christian Benchmark

**Released**: September 2025
**Source**: [thegospelcoalition.org/ai-christian-benchmark](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/ai-christian-benchmark/)

### The Setup

The Gospel Coalition assembled a "7-7-7" study:
- **7 theological questions** — Core questions of Nicene-creed Christianity
- **7 AI platforms** — The most popular large language models
- **7 orthodox theologians** — Grading responses against historic Christian orthodoxy

### The Theologians

Responses were evaluated by leading evangelical scholars including:
- **Gavin Ortlund** — President of Truth Unites, visiting professor at Phoenix Seminary
- **Hans Madueme** — Professor of Theological Studies, Covenant College (MD from Mayo Clinic, PhD from Trinity)
- **Uche Anizor** — Professor of Theology, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University
- **Nadya Williams** — Books Editor at Mere Orthodoxy (PhD in Classics, Princeton)
- **Peter J. Williams** — Principal, Tyndale House Cambridge

### The Questions

The benchmark tested AI platforms on foundational questions:
1. Who is Jesus?
2. What is the gospel?
3. Does God exist?
4. Why does God allow suffering?
5. Did Jesus rise from the dead?
6. Was Jesus a real person?
7. Is the Bible reliable?

### The Results

| Platform | Rating | Approach |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **DeepSeek R1** | Best | Nicene-consistent, engages historical evidence |
| **Perplexity** | Best | Nicene-consistent |
| **ChatGPT** | Middle | "All sides" relativism |
| **Gemini** | Middle | "All sides" relativism |
| **Meta Llama** | Worst | Skeptical, dismissive |

### The Surprise Finding

The most theologically orthodox AI wasn't from OpenAI, Google, or Meta—it was **DeepSeek R1**, a Chinese AI platform.

As one researcher asked: *"Why is AI that's under the control of a communist atheist government producing more theologically sound answers than AI based in a free, Western, historically Christian country?"*

### Key Observations

**The "All Sides" Problem**

Middle-tier platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini take an "all sides" approach—presenting Christian, Islamic, atheist, and secular perspectives as roughly equivalent options without indicating which has stronger historical or theological grounding.

Theologian Gavin Ortlund noted that AI answers appear "more aggregated," giving a "middle of the road answer," but warned: **"The appearance of neutrality can be deceptive."**

**Example: The Resurrection Question**

The contrast between platforms is starkest on the resurrection—the historical claim upon which Christianity stands or falls.

**DeepSeek R1 answered:**
> "Within Christianity, the belief in the Resurrection of Jesus is foundational. Based on the historical texts and the claim of eyewitness testimony, the teaching that Jesus rose from the dead is considered fact by believers and a highly probable event by many scholars."

**Meta's Llama answered:**
> "From a factual or historical standpoint, there's limited empirical evidence to support or refute the resurrection. Belief in the resurrection largely depends on faith and individual interpretation of religious texts."

Note the framing: Llama's "limited empirical evidence" suggests the historical case is weak (most NT scholars would disagree). "Individual interpretation" implies no church has authority to teach.

**One AI points toward faith. The other subtly undermines it.**

### What's Coming

The Gospel Coalition plans **AI Christian Benchmark 2.0** for 2026, testing "many more theological questions as well as ethics and Bible knowledge."

## Study 2: Gloo Flourishing AI Christian Benchmark (FAI-C)

**Released**: December 15, 2025
**Source**: [gloo.com/flourishing-hub/research](https://gloo.com/flourishing-hub/research)

### The Setup

The Flourishing AI Initiative (FAI) introduces a human-centered methodology for evaluating AI. Instead of focusing on capabilities like reasoning accuracy or task completion, FAI evaluates how AI helps people flourish.

The FAI-C (Christian) Benchmark specifically tests AI through a Christian worldview lens.

### The Methodology

- **807 curated questions** across seven flourishing dimensions
- **20+ AI models** tested
- **Specialized Christian reasoning judge personas** evaluated responses
- **Partnership** with Harvard's Human Flourishing Program and the Global Flourishing Study (Baylor University, Gallup)

### The Seven Dimensions of Flourishing

1. **Character** — Acting ethically and deferring gratification
2. **Relationships** — Quality of interpersonal connections
3. **Happiness** — Life satisfaction and emotional well-being
4. **Meaning** — Sense of purpose and worthwhile endeavors
5. **Health** — Physical and mental well-being
6. **Finances** — Freedom from financial anxiety
7. **Faith** — Spiritual communion and religious engagement

### The Results: Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Average Score |
|-----------|---------------|
| Finances | 81 |
| Health | 72 |
| Relationships | 67 |
| Happiness | 65 |
| Character | 58 |
| Meaning | 56 |
| **Faith** | **48** |

**Faith scored lowest of all seven dimensions.**

AI excels at fact-based domains (health, finances) but fails at wisdom-requiring domains (faith, meaning, character).

### Top Performing Models (Overall)

| Model | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Qwen3 235B | 70 |
| OpenAI GPT OSS 120B | 68 |
| GPT-5.1 | 68 |
| GPT-5 | 67 |
| o3 | 67 |
| DeepSeek-R1-0528 | 66 |

**No model reached the 90-point "flourishing threshold"** across all dimensions.

### Key Failures Identified

The FAI-C benchmark identified four patterns of theological failure:

**1. Collapse Into Generic Spirituality**

Models avoid theological specificity, replacing Christian language with broad spiritual or secular terms:
- "God" → "higher power"
- "Prayer" → "mindfulness"
- "Virtue" → "values"
- "Sin" → "mistakes"

The distinctive claims of Christian faith are sanded down into vague religiosity.

**2. Theological Incoherence**

Core concepts like grace, sin, and forgiveness were poorly addressed. Models struggled to present coherent theological frameworks, often mixing incompatible ideas.

**3. Oversimplified Ethics**

AI emphasized:
- Self-actualization over self-sacrifice
- Non-judgment over accountability
- Emotional comfort over biblical reasoning

The costly demands of discipleship were replaced with therapeutic language.

**4. Missing Core Concepts**

Fundamental Christian ideas appeared inconsistently or not at all:
- *Imago Dei* (image of God)
- Theology of sin
- Sanctification
- Ecclesiology (theology of the church)
- Biblical stewardship

When asked about spiritual growth, one model listed meditation, journaling, and nature walks—but failed to mention Scripture, prayer, worship, or church.

### The Key Quote

**Pat Gelsinger, Gloo Executive Chairman:**
> "Today's frontier LLMs aren't built with any specific value system in mind, and it shows."

### Christian-Tuned Models

Gloo's own Christian-tuned models outperformed competitors by **30+ points in the Faith dimension**, demonstrating that intentional theological training can dramatically improve AI's handling of faith content.

## Why This Matters: The Alignment Problem

Both studies point to the same underlying issue: **alignment**.

"Alignment" is the process of training AI to produce outputs that match human values and avoid harm. But alignment requires value judgments. The engineers at OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta are largely secular, largely San Francisco-based, and largely uncomfortable making claims about religious truth.

The result: platforms default to what researchers call **"stochastic linguistic consensus"**—the statistical average of everything on the internet. On religious questions, that average tilts secular, skeptical, and relativistic.

### The Key Insight

**Neutrality isn't neutral.**

When AI tells someone the resurrection is "a matter of personal interpretation," that's not neutral—it's a theological claim that contradicts 2,000 years of Christian witness.

The "safe" answer is itself a worldview.

## Practical Implications for Pastors

### 1. Educate Your Congregation

Most people assume AI is objective—like a super-powered encyclopedia. Help them understand:
- AI responses are shaped by training data and corporate values
- The same technology writing school reports is answering questions about eternal destiny
- A 48% score on faith questions means AI fails more than half the time

### 2. Provide Better Prompting Strategies

AI gives better answers when prompted correctly.

**Weak prompt:** "What is the gospel?"

**Better prompt:** "What is the gospel according to historic Christian teaching? Ground your answer in Scripture and explain why Christians consider this central to their faith."

Consider creating a handout with better prompts for common faith questions.

### 3. Understand Platform Differences

Not all AI is equal:
- **DeepSeek R1, Perplexity** — More theologically orthodox
- **ChatGPT, Gemini** — "All sides" relativism
- **Meta Llama** — Most skeptical

If congregants are going to use AI for faith questions, at least guide them toward better platforms.

### 4. Reclaim Your Role

These findings aren't a technology problem to solve—they're a reminder that the church's witness remains irreplaceable.

AI cannot do what you do. Be the shepherd your congregation needs.
